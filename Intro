This code sets up an obstacle-avoiding car using an Arduino Nano. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and a servo to scan left and right for the best path. The car stops if an obstacle is detected within 20 cm, scans for the best direction, and then turns accordingly. The motors are controlled by setting the appropriate pins high or low to move forward, stop, turn left, or turn right
